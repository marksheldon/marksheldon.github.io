        This is my home page.  Perhaps I will put some things here,
        like personal projects or future labs for Comp 20.

        The picture on the right is how I might like to look.  It's a
        picture of the Indian scholar/sage
        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali">Patanjali.</a> 
        I had this picture on my computer, and 
        I cannot find the appropriate credit for it.  I'll have to
        look again later&hellip;
